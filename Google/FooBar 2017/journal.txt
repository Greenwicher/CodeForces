LEVEL 1
======= 

Commander Lambda sure is a task-master, isn't she? You're being worked to the bone!

LEVEL 2
======= 

You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted. Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda, though, so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!

At least all this time spent running errands all over Commander Lambda's space station have given you a really good understanding of the station's layout. You'll need that when you're finally ready to destroy the LAMBCHOP and rescue the bunny prisoners.

The latest gossip in the henchman breakroom is that "LAMBCHOP" stands for "Lambda's Anti-Matter Biofuel Collision Hadron Oxidating Potentiator". You're pretty sure it runs on diesel, not biofuel, but you can at least give the commander credit for trying.

LEVEL 3
======= 

Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that she's made you her personal assistant. You'll be helping her directly with her work, which means you'll have access to all of her files-including the ones on the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for. Can you use your new access to finally topple Commander Lambda's evil empire?

As Commander Lambda's personal assistant, you get to deal with all of the paperwork involved in running a space station big enough to house the LAMBCHOP. And you thought Bunny HQ had too much bureaucracy...

Commander Lambda has six suits, three dress uniforms, four casual outfits, and one Dress-Uniform-For-Important-Speeches-Only. You know this because you've already had to take all of them to the dry cleaner's. Twice!

Who the heck puts clover and coffee creamer in their tea? Commander Lambda, apparently. When you signed up to infiltrate her organization, you didn't think you'd get such an up-close and personal look at her more...unusual tastes.

LEVEL 4
======= 

Excellent! You've destroyed Commander Lambda's doomsday device and saved Bunny Planet! But there's one small problem: the LAMBCHOP was a wool-y important part of her space station, and when you blew it up, you triggered a chain reaction that's tearing the station apart. Can you rescue the imprisoned bunnies and escape before the entire thing explodes?

You're pretty sure that last CRASH-BANG-THUD noise was the Sector C central support column collapsing. At least there's nothing in Sector C except the clover and coffee creamer storage. 

'Destroy a doomsday device,' they said. 'Rescue prisoners,' they said. 'Be a hero,' they said. They didn't mention anything about having to escape through a trash compactor that could turn on at any time. Doesn't anyone in Bunny HQ watch movies?!

Was that the sound of the spa facility imploding? You say a mournful mental goodbye to its sauna and massage tables. It's too bad - after all this scrambling, you really could use a nice relaxing day at the spa. 

LEVEL 5
======= 

Oh no! You escaped Commander Lambda's exploding space station - but so did she, and she's definitely not happy with you. She's chasing you in her heavily-armed starfighter, while you and your bunny refugees are stuck in these lumbering escape pods. It'll take all your wits and cleverness to escape such a hare-y situation, so you'd better hop to it!

EPILOGUE
======== 

With one last roar of the escape pod's engines, you and your bunny companions jump to lightspeed. Congratulations! You've destroyed the LAMBCHOP, rescued the bunnies, gotten Commander Lambda off your tail, and saved the galaxy. Time for a little rest and relaxation back on Bunny Planet. Pat yourself on the back - you've earned it!
